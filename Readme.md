Handlebars Expander
===================
A grunt task to compile and run handlebars templates offline.

Motivation
----------
If you ever used (FluentD)[http://www.fluentd.org/] you might have noticed
that the configuration files tend to be repetitive.
For example all file inputs will have more or less the same structure
but you have to write it repeatedly.

Another example is (Apache)[http://httpd.apache.org/] VirtualHost configuration.
If all of your virtual hosts share the same basic options why would you
create them multiple times?
